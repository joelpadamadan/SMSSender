# SMSSender

SMSSender is a java-based application which uses a GSM modem to send SMS to a list of numbers saved using this application. Users can create a persistent list of contacts and also create groups of number to which messages can be sent. Message templates can also be made so that the user need not have to recompose messages that are frequently used. 
Custom message is another feature that will help the users to send custom messages to contacts. For Example, The name, time elapsed, chest number and rank of the participant in a marathon has to be sent to each participants after completing the event. In such a case a .csv file containing all the details of the participant along with the mobile number can used to send messages to all the participants with their details.
